C&amp;C: Tiberium Alliances Base Overlay user-script

This script enhances the gameplay of the browser game http://tiberiumalliances.com. It provides a quick way to overlay the relationship between costs and gain of building upgrades, by holding down the Control key.

This feature is based on the same feature at http://cncopt.com/.
Some code snippets are based on the HuffyLuf extensions of the Maelstrom Tools: http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/140991
